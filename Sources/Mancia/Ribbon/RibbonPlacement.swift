/// Where the command ribbon sits, resolved from screen and host-window
/// geometry. Pure and free of AppKit lookups so every branch is unit-testable;
/// `RibbonWindow` supplies a `Context` built from live `NSScreen` /
/// Accessibility values.
///
/// The rule the ribbon rests on:
///
/// > When the host reports where the selected text is, sit against it: just
/// > under the span, just over it if it sits too near the foot of the display
/// > to fit beneath, and in the margin beside it when it is too tall for
/// > either end. The window around the text has no say in any of that.
/// > Otherwise — a bare caret, so the whole document is the target, or a host
/// > that cannot answer — take the predictable place: flush below the menu bar
/// > when the screen reserves a strip for it, or inset below the frontmost
/// > window's title bar when it does not.
///
/// The lane used to take the predictable place always, and drop to the *foot
/// of the host* when it would otherwise cover the selection. That cleared the
/// text but overshot: a selection near the top of a window sent the lane the
/// entire height of the screen away from the sentence it was invoked on, so
/// the user read the result nowhere near where they were looking. Sitting
/// against the selection clears the same text and moves as little as possible
/// doing it, and it puts the command the user is composing next to the words
/// it will rewrite.
///
/// A selection tall enough to leave no room at either end used to send the
/// lane back to that predictable place — the same overshoot in a new costume,
/// and worse, because the lane then landed *on* the head of the block it was
/// invoked on. A tall selection is usually a narrow one: a paragraph is a
/// column of text with a margin either side of it. So before retreating, the
/// rule looks along the selection's flanks, where a lane covers nothing at
/// all. Only a block with no room at its ends *and* no margin beside it — a
/// select-all in a maximized window, where every position covers the text
/// equally — falls back, and then it takes the roomier end anyway if the lane
/// can stand clear of the words there as it opens.
///
/// Whichever edge faces the selection is the edge the lane *pins*, so it grows
/// away from the text. An end with room for `projectedHeight`, or a margin the
/// lane owns outright, stays clear as the review gate opens. The cramped-end
/// fallback is the deliberate exception: its opening row clears the words,
/// but screen clamping can move a grown gate back over the far end.
///
/// The selected span drives *both* axes, and the host window drives neither.
/// A lane at an end of the selection is centered on the span and as wide as
/// its current content asks for, bounded by the span and held between
/// `minimumWidth` and `maximumWidth` — a window ten times the width of the
/// sentence being edited is no reason to put the lane ten paragraphs away from
/// it, and one narrower than the lane is no reason to squeeze it. Room is
/// measured against the display's band for the same reason: the lane floats
/// over its host rather than inside it. A lane in the margin is bounded by that
/// margin instead, so it never reaches back over the words. The window is
/// consulted for the resting anchors alone, which is where the lane goes when
/// no selection points anywhere better.
///
/// One amendment after each apply: pasting can put words where the opening
/// geometry never described them — a longer result flows past the old
/// selection's foot, and hosts scroll to keep the caret visible. When the
/// lane is found covering the text it just wrote (`laneObstructs` against
/// `updatedTextRect`), the anchor is re-decided against where that text
/// actually is. A lane already clear of the words holds still: the user's
/// eye is on the result, and a move that buys no visibility is churn.
///
/// The predictable place is chosen by measurement rather than a capability
/// query: `screenFrame.maxY - visibleFrame.maxY`. `visibleFrame` excludes the
/// menu bar at the top and the Dock at the bottom or sides, so the *top* gap
/// isolates the menu-bar strip.
///
/// On a notched display that measurement is not enough on its own. There the
/// top strip is permanently unavailable to ordinary windows, so `visibleFrame`
/// stops short of `frame` whether or not a menu bar is drawn — measured on a
/// 14" MacBook Pro, the gap is 33pt with the menu bar shown, 32pt with it
/// auto-hidden, and still 33pt while another app owns a full-screen Space.
/// Geometry alone therefore cannot separate the two states, so `menuBarHidden`
