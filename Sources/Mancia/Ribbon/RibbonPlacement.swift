/// Where the command ribbon sits, resolved from screen and host-window
/// geometry. Pure and free of AppKit lookups so every branch is unit-testable;
/// `RibbonWindow` supplies a `Context` built from live `NSScreen` /
/// Accessibility values.
///
/// The rule the ribbon rests on:
///
/// > When the host reports where the selected text is, sit just under it —
/// > just over it if the selection is too near the foot of the host to fit
/// > beneath. Otherwise — a bare caret, or a host that cannot answer — take
/// > the predictable place: flush below the menu bar when the screen reserves
/// > a strip for it, or inset below the frontmost window's title bar when it
/// > does not.
///
/// The lane used to take the predictable place always, and drop to the *foot
/// of the host* when it would otherwise cover the selection. That cleared the
/// text but overshot: a selection near the top of a window sent the lane the
/// entire height of the screen away from the sentence it was invoked on, so
/// the user read the result nowhere near where they were looking. Sitting
/// against the selection clears the same text and moves as little as possible
/// doing it, and it puts the command the user is composing next to the words
/// it will rewrite.
///
/// Whichever edge the lane hangs from is the edge it *pins*, so it grows away
/// from the selection: a review gate opening under a lane that sits beneath
/// the text can never creep back over the line it was invoked on. Which is
/// also why the room beside the selection is judged at `projectedHeight`
/// rather than the height the lane opens at.
///
/// Vertical position follows the selection. Horizontally, the lane opens near
/// the pointer that invoked it and holds that position for the session; when
/// no pointer on the target display is available, it centers on the host.
///
/// One amendment after each apply: pasting can put words where the opening
/// geometry never described them — a longer result flows past the old
/// selection's foot, and hosts scroll to keep the caret visible. When the
/// lane is found covering the text it just wrote (`laneObstructs` against
/// `updatedTextRect`), the anchor is re-decided against where that text
/// actually is. A lane already clear of the words holds still: the user's
/// eye is on the result, and a move that buys no visibility is churn.
///
/// The predictable place is chosen by measurement rather than a capability
/// query: `screenFrame.maxY - visibleFrame.maxY`. `visibleFrame` excludes the
/// menu bar at the top and the Dock at the bottom or sides, so the *top* gap
/// isolates the menu-bar strip.
///
/// On a notched display that measurement is not enough on its own. There the
/// top strip is permanently unavailable to ordinary windows, so `visibleFrame`
/// stops short of `frame` whether or not a menu bar is drawn — measured on a
/// 14" MacBook Pro, the gap is 33pt with the menu bar shown, 32pt with it
/// auto-hidden, and still 33pt while another app owns a full-screen Space.
/// Geometry alone therefore cannot separate the two states, so `menuBarHidden`
/// carries the answer explicitly; see `RibbonWindow.currentContext()`.
