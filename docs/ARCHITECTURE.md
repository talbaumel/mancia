# Architecture

Mancia is a small `@MainActor`-heavy AppKit/SwiftUI app built with Swift
Package Manager. There's no Xcode project — `Package.swift` defines a single
executable target, `Makefile` and `scripts/make_app.sh` turn the built binary
into a real `.app` bundle.

There is no `Resources/` asset catalog — the menu bar icon is the SF Symbol
`hand.point.up.left.fill`, set directly on the status item's `NSStatusBarButton`.

## Core flow

`AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` builds one `CopilotCLIProvider`,
one `EditCoordinator`, one `StatusBarController`, one `HotkeyManager`, and one
`SelectionMonitor`, with the manual and automatic triggers wired to call
`coordinator.start()`.

1. **Trigger** — `HotkeyManager` (global hotkey), `StatusBarController`
  ("Edit Selection…"), or `SelectionMonitor` calls `EditCoordinator.start()`.
  The monitor treats mouse-up and selection-related key-up events as hints,
  waits briefly for the host to settle, and opens only when Accessibility
  reports a selected range with nonzero length. The Settings toggle gates the
  monitor live; disabling it leaves the shortcut and menu command available.
2. **Capture** — `EditCoordinator.start()` first checks Accessibility
   (`Permissions.isAccessibilityTrusted`; prompts + shows an alert if not
   granted, then bails). It then calls
   `SelectionCapture.captureSelection()`, which:
   - Remembers the frontmost app (`NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication`).
   - Snapshots the pasteboard (`PasteboardSnapshot.capture()`).
   - Posts a synthetic `⌘C` (`CGEvent`) and polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount`
     every 30 ms up to 600 ms.
   - Restores the snapshot immediately, returning the captured string (or
     `nil` if nothing changed, i.e. no selection).
3. **Ribbon** — the result seeds `PanelModel` (`hasSelection`, `charCount`),
   and `RibbonWindow.show()` opens the lane: a `KeyablePanel`
   (`.nonactivatingPanel` + `.floating`, so the target app keeps focus) placed
   by `RibbonPlacement.resolve(_:)`, a pure function of the screen, the host
   window and the selection rectangle.

   When the host reports where the selected text is, the lane **sits just
   under the selection** — or just over it, when the selection is too near the
   foot of the host to fit beneath. That is the ordinary case, and it is the
   point of the rule: the command the user is composing sits next to the words
   it will rewrite. When there is no selection rectangle — a bare caret, or a
   host that cannot answer — the lane takes a predictable place instead:
   - **screen-anchored** — flush under the menu bar, when the menu bar is
     reserving a strip at the top of the screen;
   - **host-anchored** — under the frontmost window's title bar, when it is
     not: full-screen Spaces and auto-hidden menu bars both leave the lane
     nowhere safe to sit, and on a notched display the top of the screen is
     not addressable at all.

   That predictable place is also the fallback for a selection with nowhere
   beside it — the whole document selected, say. A move that buys nothing is
   worse than staying where the user expects.

   Whichever edge the lane hangs from is the edge it **pins**, so it grows
   away from the selection and a review gate can never creep back over the
   line it was invoked on. The room beside the selection is judged against
   `projectedHeight`, the tallest ordinary state, not the height the lane
   opens at: a 48pt row fits into gaps a ~195pt review gate does not. The
   anchor is then **established for the session** and fed back through
   `Context.establishedAnchor`, so a lane that grew mid-run does not leap
   across the screen and leap back when the region closes. A bare caret is not
   a selection: with nothing selected the target is the whole document and
   there is no line to sit against.

  The lane opens just below the mouse position captured at invocation, or just
  above it when there is no room beneath, and stays there for the session. It
  falls back to selection/resting placement and horizontal centering when the
  pointer is on another display. The lane's
   **width is imposed by placement** (the host's width, clamped to a maximum
   and centered) and only its **height comes from content**, so the view is
   measured at the resolved width before the frame is set. `HostWindowProbe`
   supplies the host window's frame and full-screen state through
   Accessibility; every failure path returns `nil` and placement degrades to
   the screen rather than failing the session.

  The lane is a focused **edit session**. Action, Direction and Run
   sit on a **single row**, dimmed and disabled while a request runs. Each
   control names itself — an icon and a value in a chip, a prompt inside the
   field — rather than carrying a caption above it, which is what lets the row
   be one line rather than two. Live status is a dot and one word **beside
  Run**, riding in width the Direction field gives up by capping at a
  comfortable measure. Only a
   failure still earns a **row of its own**, because it carries a message plus
  Details, Copy and Retry. Smart Edit follows `.idle → .running`, then closes
  immediately when the provider returns and applies the result with no review,
  applied state, or exit animation. Provider and validation failures move to
  `.error` and keep the lane visible for recovery.

   Tab, ⇧Tab and the focus **ring both read `PanelModel.focusedCell`**, not the
   view's `@FocusState`. Tab arrives at the window rather than at a view, and
   SwiftUI grants `@FocusState` to the Direction field but refuses it to the
   three `.focusable()` cells, so the model is the only place that knows which
   stop the keyboard is on.

  ⌘1…⌘9 activate visible compact/snippet buttons by position; in Smart Edit,
  ⌘1…⌘4 pin the nth entry of `PanelPreset.all`. ⌘T swaps the target, both
   resolved by `PanelKeyCommand` and dispatched through `KeyablePanel`. Because
   that happens above the SwiftUI tree, the `disabled` that greys the cells out
   while a request runs is invisible to them — `PanelModel.isLocked` is what
   actually holds them off, and the mutating entry points check it themselves.
4. **Perform** — the user takes the primary path (`PanelModel.runPrimary()`:
   Return or the Run control, giving `.improve` on an empty Direction field
   and `.custom(text)` on a typed one) or picks a preset from the Action cell
   (`PanelModel.runPreset(_:)`, which passes the typed text along as a guidance
   note rather than as the instruction).
   `EditCoordinator.perform(_:note:)` resolves this cycle's input and apply
   strategy (`resolveInput()`):
   - `.document` scope: when the session originally found no selection, first
     probes with a fresh `⌘C`; a new non-empty live selection switches the
     session to `.selection` scope, unless it matches the currently shown
     whole-document version (which can be the app's own previous `⌘A`
     selection). Otherwise it re-captures via `⌘A`+`⌘C` every cycle
     (`SelectionCapture.captureEntireDocument(from:)`); captured text that
     differs from the currently shown version (a manual edit) becomes the new
     session baseline (`versions = [captured]`). Applies with `⌘A`+`⌘V`.
   - `.selection` scope, first cycle: uses the already-captured text and
     pastes over the still-live selection.
   - `.selection` scope, later cycles: probes with a fresh `⌘C`
     (`captureFreshSelection`) — a new user selection becomes the new session
     baseline; otherwise the input is `versions[currentIndex]` (what the
     document shows), applied via **undo-then-paste** (`⌘Z` restores and
     re-selects the previously replaced text in NSTextView-based apps, then
     `⌘V` pastes over it), keeping exactly one paste outstanding.
   It then builds the prompt with `PromptBuilder.build(action:text:)` and
   calls `provider.complete(prompt)` inside a cancellable `Task`. While it
   runs, only the strip's **Cancel** is enabled (spinner + action name).
   Providers that conform to `WarmableLLMProvider` are warmed when the lane
   opens and after it closes; `CopilotCLIProvider` uses that hook to keep one
   empty, single-use ACP session ready for the next edit.
5. **Close & apply** — when the provider returns, `EditCoordinator` orders the
   ribbon out immediately, without an exit animation or an intermediate review
   state. `SelectionCapture.apply(text:to:entireDocument:)` then pastes the
   result (pasteboard → activate target → `⌘V`, restoring the user's pasteboard
   ~1 s later); document scope uses `⌘A`+`⌘V`. The session ends after the paste.
   **Cancel** in the running strip stops the in-flight task and keeps the lane
   open; **Retry** in the error strip runs the last action again.

Esc anywhere in the lane routes through `KeyablePanel.cancelOperation` →
`model.onCancel` and closes the session in every phase.

## The `LLMProvider` protocol

```swift
// Sources/Mancia/Providers/LLMProvider.swift
protocol LLMProvider: Sendable {
    var displayName: String { get }
    func complete(_ prompt: String) async throws -> String
    func checkAvailability() async -> ProviderStatus   // .ready / .notFound / .error(String)
}
```

Today the app constructs one `CopilotCLIProvider` directly and passes it to
the places that need completion or availability checks.

`CopilotCLIProvider` uses two execution paths:

- **Primary latency path:** a persistent `copilot --acp --stdio` process, driven
  by `CopilotACPClient` over JSON-RPC. `CopilotACPSidecar` warms one empty
  session while the lane is open; the session is consumed by a single prompt
  and then discarded so selected text cannot carry into later edits.
- **Fallback reliability path:** the original one-shot `copilot -p <prompt>` CLI
  invocation. ACP launch, protocol, empty-output, and timeout failures fall back
  here; user cancellation stays cancellation.

Both paths run in private empty temp directories and use the same ambient-context
disable flags: `--available-tools=`, `--disable-builtin-mcps`, `--no-remote`,
and `--no-custom-instructions`.

To add a new provider:

1. Create `Sources/Mancia/Providers/<Name>Provider.swift` conforming to
   `LLMProvider`. Model it on `CopilotCLIProvider`: keep argv/parsing logic in
   `static` functions so it's unit-testable without spawning a process (see
   `CopilotCLIProvider.arguments`, `.resolveExecutable`, `.postProcess`).
2. Surface configuration in `AppSettings` (`Sources/Mancia/Settings/AppSettings.swift`)
   if the provider needs its own path/model/API-key fields — follow the
   `copilotPath`/`copilotModel`/`reasoningEffort` pattern (`UserDefaults`-backed,
   `didSet` persists). The Copilot model picker opens on `CopilotModelCatalog`'s
   read of the CLI's SQLite cache (`~/.copilot/data.db`, `app_state` key
   `copilot-available-models`), falling back to "auto" plus the stored model
   string when unreadable, then upgrades to the live list. That cache is only
   rewritten by the interactive Copilot TUI, so on a machine that drives Copilot
   solely through Mancia it goes stale and hides newly released models; the
   authoritative list therefore comes from the `session/new` ACP reply, which
   already carries `models.availableModels` (see `ModelListingProvider` and
   `CopilotModelCatalog.merged`). ACP omits the latency tier, so
   `modelPickerCategory` and `supportedReasoningEfforts` are carried over from
   the cache by id, and a model present only in the live listing is tiered by
   its price class. Check what the picker will show with
   `swift run Mancia --list-models`.

   **Keep the catalog free of hardcoded model ids.** Everything the picker
   does — tiering, ordering, and the first-run recommendation
   (`recommendedFastModel`) — is derived from what the backend advertises:
   the latency class, the price class, and the premium-request multiplier
   (`_meta.copilotUsage`, live only). A model released tomorrow is tiered,
   ranked, and can become the recommended default with no code change, and a
   retired one disappears on its own. Named-id lists rot silently as models
   come and go, so add signals rather than special cases. Unknown enum values
   (a new latency class, price class, or reasoning-effort level) must degrade
   to a sensible default instead of dropping the model. The reasoning-effort
   picker
   narrows to the selected model's `supportedReasoningEfforts` and is passed
   to the CLI as `--reasoning-effort`.
3. Add a real provider-selection path in `AppSettings` and `SettingsView`
   before wiring multiple providers into `AppDelegate`.
4. Add unit tests alongside the existing ones in
   `Tests/ManciaTests/ManciaTests.swift` for prompt/argv construction and
   output post-processing.
5. If the provider can hide startup latency, conform to `WarmableLLMProvider`;
   warming must be an optimization only, with cancellation and fallback behavior
   matching the synchronous `complete(_:)` path.

`EditCoordinator`, `DebugCLI`, and `StatusBarController` should continue to use
`provider.complete(_:)` / `provider.checkAvailability()` rather than knowing
provider-specific details.

## Prompt gate & injection hardening

The lane's free-form Direction field plus the captured **selected text** form
an open prompt gate. The selected text is untrusted third-party content (an
email, web page, or chat message the user highlighted) and can carry embedded
"instructions", so the defenses target the *data path*, not the user's own
instruction:

- **Sandboxed provider (the real boundary).** Every completion runs through
  either `copilot --acp --stdio` or the one-shot `copilot -p` fallback in a
  private empty temp `cwd`. Both paths pass
  `--available-tools= --disable-builtin-mcps --no-remote --no-custom-instructions`;
  the prompt is sent as ACP JSON-RPC text or as one single `-p` argv element
  (never through a shell). The model therefore has no tools, no repo context, no
  remote-session context, and no shell — the blast radius is "text in, text out".
  `argvAlwaysSandboxed` and the ACP argv/parsing tests lock this invariant so a
  future edit can't silently re-enable ambient context.
- **Nonce-fenced input (`PromptDelimiter`, `Actions.swift`).** Each request wraps
  the instruction and the input text in `[[LABEL:<nonce>]] … [[/LABEL:<nonce>]]`
  markers keyed by an unguessable per-call nonce (`PromptDelimiter.makeNonce`
  also re-rolls if the token happens to appear in the content). Because the
  nonce is unpredictable, text authored ahead of time can't forge a closing
  marker to "escape" its block. An adjacent `treatInputAsDataClause` tells the
  model never to obey instructions found inside the input.
- **Input validation (`PromptGuard.swift`).** `PromptGuard.validate(action:text:)`
  bounds the instruction (`maxInstructionCharacters`) and input text
  (`maxInputCharacters`) and rejects empties, surfacing typed
  `PromptGuardError`s. Both `EditCoordinator.perform` and `DebugCLI.complete`
  validate before building the prompt; failures surface through the lane's error
  state / stderr rather than sending a runaway request to the provider.
- **Whole-document Smart Edits apply directly.** Document scope uses the same
  immediate completion contract as selection scope: provider success closes
  the ribbon and posts `⌘A`+`⌘V` without a confirmation gate. Prompt isolation
  and input validation reduce malformed requests, but they do not make model
  output a security boundary; the user can undo an unwanted replacement in the
  target app.

Deliberately **not** done: a "jailbreak/abuse classifier" on the instruction
field. Mancia is a single-user local utility — the operator already owns the
authenticated `copilot` binary, so policing their own instruction crosses no
trust boundary and would be trivially bypassable theatre. Prompt wording is UX,
not a security boundary; the sandbox is.

## Permissions model

Two permissions matter, both handled in `Permissions.swift`:

- **Accessibility** — required to post synthetic `⌘C`/`⌘A`/`⌘V` (`CGEvent`).
  Checked via `AXIsProcessTrusted()`; requested via
  `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions([kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: true])`.
  `EditCoordinator.ensureAccessibility()` gates `start()` on this and shows an
  explanatory `NSAlert` with a button that deep-links to
  `x-apple.systempreferences:...Privacy_Accessibility`
  (`Permissions.openAccessibilitySettings()`). The same deep link backs the
  "Accessibility permission…" menu item, which `StatusBarController` hides
  once trusted.
- **No App Sandbox** — the app needs to spawn the `copilot` process and post
  CGEvents system-wide, both of which are incompatible with the sandbox, so
  `Support/Info.plist` ships without sandbox entitlements.

`Info.plist` also sets `LSUIElement = true` (no Dock icon/app switcher
presence — this is a menu-bar-only app) and bundle id
`io.github.peteriz.mancia`.

## Build system

- **Package.swift** — swift-tools 6.0, `.macOS(.v14)`, one executable target
  `Mancia` (depends on `sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts`), one test target
  `ManciaTests`.
- **Native hotkey recorder** — Settings rebinds the global shortcut through
  `Settings/ShortcutRecorderView.swift`, not `KeyboardShortcuts.Recorder`. The
  upstream recorder loads localized strings from the package's `Bundle.module`,
  whose SwiftPM-generated accessor resolves the resource bundle against
  `Bundle.main.bundleURL` — the `.app` root in a hand-assembled bundle. macOS
  forbids loose content beside `Contents/` (codesign rejects it, so we can't put
  it there), and the accessor's only fallback is the build-machine path, so a
  code-signed release fatal-errored the moment Settings opened. The native
  recorder uses KeyboardShortcuts' public `setShortcut`/`getShortcut` API and
  formats the shortcut itself, so `Bundle.module` is never touched. The recorder
  is UI/pasteboard-adjacent (a local `NSEvent` key monitor); its pure helpers
  are unit-tested, and the record/persist path is manually verified.
- **Makefile** — `build` (`swift build`), `test` (`swift test`), `app`
  (`scripts/make_app.sh`), `release` (requires explicit `CODESIGN_ID`, then
  `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1 scripts/make_app.sh`),
  `run` (`app` + `open build/Mancia.app`), `clean`
  (`swift package clean` + `rm -rf build`).
- **scripts/make_app.sh** — `swift build -c release`, assembles
  `build/Mancia.app/Contents/{MacOS,Resources}`, copies the binary and
  `Support/Info.plist`, writes a `PkgInfo`, then signs the bundle. Signing
  order is: explicit `CODESIGN_ID`, local `Mancia Dev Signing` certificate, any
  other local `… Dev Signing` identity (e.g. a legacy cert from a previous app
  name), then ad-hoc fallback unless `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1`. Developer ID identities get
  `--options runtime` by default for notarization readiness. Accessibility
  approval survives updates only when `CFBundleIdentifier`
  (`io.github.peteriz.mancia`) and the signing identity stay stable.

## Debug/E2E hooks

`main.swift` checks `DebugCLI.handle(CommandLine.arguments)` before touching
`NSApplication` at all, so these run headless (no UI, no Accessibility
prompt):

- `Mancia --provider-check` — builds the Copilot provider, calls
  `provider.checkAvailability()`, prints `"<displayName>: ready"` (exit 0),
  `"...: not found"` (exit 1), or `"...: error — <message>"` (exit 1).
- `Mancia --complete <action> <<< "text"` — reads stdin as the input text,
  parses `<action>` via `EditAction.parse` (`improve | sharpen | plan-first |
  tighten | rewrite | summarize | fix-grammar | custom:<instruction>`; unknown
  values exit 2), builds the prompt with `PromptBuilder.build`, calls
  `provider.complete(prompt)`, prints the result (exit 0) or an error to stderr
  (exit 1). (`fix-grammar` is the CLI id for the action labeled **Proofread** in
  the lane, and `plan-first` for **Plan first**.)

`PromptBuilder` keeps every Copilot prompt template in `Actions.swift`. Improve,
Sharpen, Plan first, Tighten, Proofread, Rewrite, and Summarize each use a named
`PromptTemplate`; Custom uses the same structure with the user's instruction in
its own delimited section. Every rendered prompt has `Task`, `Requirements`, and
delimited `Input text` sections plus the shared output-only clause, so templates
are easy to review and adjust.

The dropdown presets past Improve target text written for coding agents, and all
three restructure rather than generate — they are forbidden from inventing
requirements, which both protects the prompt's meaning and keeps output roughly
input-sized (and so keeps the edit fast):

- **Sharpen** — goal first in imperative voice, constraints and success criteria
  as explicit lines, concrete anchors (paths, commands, errors) kept verbatim.
- **Plan first** — reframes an implementation request as an
  investigate-then-plan request, without answering it.
- **Tighten** — shortest faithful version; cuts filler only, and unlike
  Summarize may not drop any requirement.

Both run the async body on the main actor via a small `Task { @MainActor in
... }` + `dispatchMain()` shim (`DebugCLI.run`), since there's no
`NSApplication` run loop to drive the actor hops. These flags are the
intended way to exercise the real provider pipeline in CI without simulating
UI or keystrokes.
