# Architecture

Mancia is a small `@MainActor`-heavy AppKit/SwiftUI app built with Swift
Package Manager. There's no Xcode project — `Package.swift` defines a single
executable target, `Makefile` and `scripts/make_app.sh` turn the built binary
into a real `.app` bundle.

There is no `Resources/` asset catalog — the menu bar icon is the SF Symbol
`hand.point.up.left.fill`, set directly on the status item's `NSStatusBarButton`.

## Core flow

`AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` builds one `CopilotCLIProvider`,
one `EditCoordinator`, one `StatusBarController`, and one `HotkeyManager`, all
wired to call `coordinator.start()`.

1. **Trigger** — `HotkeyManager` (global hotkey) or `StatusBarController`
   ("Edit Selection…") calls `EditCoordinator.start()`.
2. **Capture** — `EditCoordinator.start()` first checks Accessibility
   (`Permissions.isAccessibilityTrusted`; prompts + shows an alert if not
   granted, then bails). It then calls
   `SelectionCapture.captureSelection()`, which:
   - Remembers the frontmost app (`NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication`).
   - Snapshots the pasteboard (`PasteboardSnapshot.capture()`).
   - Posts a synthetic `⌘C` (`CGEvent`) and polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount`
     every 30 ms up to 600 ms.
   - Restores the snapshot immediately, returning the captured string (or
     `nil` if nothing changed, i.e. no selection).
3. **Ribbon** — the result seeds `PanelModel` (`hasSelection`, `charCount`),
   and `RibbonWindow.show()` opens the lane: a `KeyablePanel`
   (`.nonactivatingPanel` + `.floating`, so the target app keeps focus) placed
   by `RibbonPlacement.resolve(_:)`, a pure function of the screen, the host
   window and the selection rectangle.

   When the host reports where the selected text is, the lane **sits just
   under the selection** — or just over it, when the selection is too near the
   foot of the display to fit beneath. That is the ordinary case, and it is the
   point of the rule: the command the user is composing sits next to the words
   it will rewrite. When the block is too tall for either end — a paragraph, a
   long quote — the lane **stands in the margin beside it**, on the roomier
   flank, as wide as that margin can hold. A tall selection is usually a
   narrow one, so the margin is nearly always there, and a lane standing in it
   covers no text at all. When there is no selection rectangle — a bare caret,
   so the whole document is the target, or a host that cannot answer — the lane
   takes a predictable place instead:
   - **screen-anchored** — flush under the menu bar, when the menu bar is
     reserving a strip at the top of the screen;
   - **host-anchored** — under the frontmost window's title bar, when it is
     not: full-screen Spaces and auto-hidden menu bars both leave the lane
     nowhere safe to sit, and on a notched display the top of the screen is
     not addressable at all.

   That predictable place is the last resort, and only for a selection with
   nowhere at all beside it — everything on screen selected, say, where every
   position covers the text as thoroughly as the next. Before it comes the
   **cramped end**: a block with no margin either side still gets the lane at
   whichever end can hold it as it opens (`crampedRoom`), because covering the
   head of a block from the far end of the screen is worse than standing
   against its foot. A move that buys nothing is worse than staying where the
   user expects; a move that buys the whole point of the rule is not.

   Whichever edge faces the selection is the edge the lane **pins**, so it
   grows away from the text. An end with room for `projectedHeight`, or a
   margin the lane owns outright, stays clear as the review gate opens. The
   cramped-end fallback is the deliberate exception: its opening row clears
   the words, but screen clamping can move a grown gate back over the block's
   far end. The anchor is **established for the session** and fed back through
   `Context.establishedAnchor`, so a lane that grew mid-run does not leap
   across the screen and leap back when the region closes. A bare caret is not
   a selection: with nothing selected the target is the whole document and
   there is no line to sit against.

   Vertical *and* horizontal position follow the selection: the lane is
   centered on the selected span, and the room at its ends and flanks is
   measured against the **display's band**, never the host window. The lane
   floats over its host rather than inside it, so a window much wider than the
   sentence is no reason to put the lane half a screen from it, and a window
   shorter than the room below the words is no reason to send the lane over
   them. The lane's **width is imposed by placement**: buttons-only states ask
   for the stable 600pt standard width and Custom asks for up to 900pt, then an
   end anchor bounds that request by the selected span, a margin anchor by its
   available flank, and a resting anchor by the window or screen. Every result
   stays between `minimumWidth` and `maximumWidth`. Only the lane's **height
   comes from content**, so the view is measured at the resolved width before
   the frame is set.
   `HostWindowProbe` supplies the host window's frame and full-screen state
   through Accessibility; every failure path returns `nil` and placement
   degrades to the screen rather than failing the session.

   The lane is a cyclical **edit session**. Target, five tight Action buttons and
   Run sit on a **single row**, dimmed and disabled while a request runs.
   Selecting Custom moves it to the leading edge, inserts Direction after it,
   and expands the whole lane horizontally. Hovering an action replaces its
   title with its ⌘1…⌘5 shortcut without changing the button's size. Each
   control names itself rather than carrying a caption above it. Running and
   applied status replace the text **inside Run**, while iteration history stays
   beside it. When disclosed, Direction
   takes the row's slack up to a comfortable measure. Only a
   failure still earns a **row of its own**, because it carries a message plus
   Details, Copy and Retry. `PanelModel.phase` cycles
   `.idle → .running → .confirm → .applied/.error` and back until the user
   closes it. The lane **stays visible throughout**: all synthetic keystrokes
   are posted directly to the target app's process (`CGEvent.postToPid`), so
   they cannot be swallowed by the lane and no hide/reveal dance is needed.
   After each keystroke burst (which activates the target app) the coordinator
   calls `ribbon.focus()` to retake key status so Esc and typing reach the
   lane again.

   Tab, ⇧Tab and the focus **ring both read `PanelModel.focusedCell`**, not the
   view's `@FocusState`. Tab arrives at the window rather than at a view, and
   SwiftUI grants `@FocusState` to the Direction field but refuses it to the
   live `.focusable()` cells, so the model is the only place that knows which
   stop the keyboard is on. Every action button is a stop; Direction joins the
   ring immediately after Custom only while the field is disclosed.

   ⌘1…⌘4 immediately run Improve, Sharpen, Plan first, and Tighten; ⌘5 moves
   Custom left, discloses its field, and focuses it without running. ⌘T swaps the target. These
   commands are resolved by `PanelKeyCommand` and dispatched through
   `KeyablePanel`. Because
   that happens above the SwiftUI tree, the `disabled` that greys the cells out
   while a request runs is invisible to them — `PanelModel.isLocked` is what
   actually holds them off, and the mutating entry points check it themselves.
4. **Perform** — the user takes the primary path (`PanelModel.runPrimary()`:
   Return or Run executes the explicitly selected preset, or `.custom(text)`
   when Custom is selected and non-empty). ⌘1…⌘4 dispatch their built-in actions
   directly. Hidden custom draft text never rides along with
   a preset.
   `EditCoordinator.perform(_:note:)` resolves this cycle's input and apply
   strategy. The rules are `EditSession`'s — a pure, AppKit-free step machine
   that the coordinator drives, asking for one observation at a time (probe
   the frontmost app, capture a new target, probe for a fresh selection,
   capture the document) until it answers with a run or an abort. Ahead of
   both scope branches it checks whether the user has moved to a different
   app, since neither branch can tell that the session's target went stale
   underneath it; only a live selection in the new app re-targets, and doing
   so resets the baseline. The two scope branches:
   - `.document` scope: when the session originally found no selection, first
     probes with a fresh `⌘C`; a new non-empty live selection switches the
     session to `.selection` scope, unless it matches the currently shown
     whole-document version (which can be the app's own previous `⌘A`
     selection). Otherwise it re-captures via `⌘A`+`⌘C` every cycle
     (`SelectionCapture.captureEntireDocument(from:)`); captured text that
     differs from the currently shown version (a manual edit) becomes the new
     session baseline (`versions = [captured]`). Applies with `⌘A`+`⌘V`.
   - `.selection` scope, first cycle: uses the already-captured text and
     pastes over the still-live selection.
   - `.selection` scope, later cycles: probes with a fresh `⌘C`
     (`captureFreshSelection`) — a new user selection becomes the new session
     baseline; otherwise the input is `versions[currentIndex]` (what the
     document shows), applied via **undo-then-paste** (`⌘Z` restores and
     re-selects the previously replaced text in NSTextView-based apps, then
     `⌘V` pastes over it), keeping exactly one paste outstanding.
   It then builds the prompt with `PromptBuilder.build(action:text:)` and
   calls `provider.complete(prompt)` inside a cancellable `Task`. While it
   runs, only the strip's **Cancel** is enabled (spinner + action name).
   Providers that conform to `WarmableLLMProvider` are warmed when the lane
   opens and after it closes; `CopilotCLIProvider` uses that hook to keep one
   empty, single-use ACP session ready for the next edit.
5. **Confirm (whole-document only)** — before a `.document`-scope result
   overwrites the document, the panel pauses in `PanelModel.phase == .confirm`
   (`ApplyConfirmation.isRequired`, gated by
   `AppSettings.confirmWholeDocumentReplace`, default on). The strip shows the
   size change (`ApplyConfirmation.summary`) alongside **Replace** (⏎ /
   `EditCoordinator.confirmApply()`), and **Cancel** discards the pending
   result. Selection edits skip this — they are
   low blast-radius and undoable — and apply straight away. This keeps an
   injection-influenced or runaway result from silently replacing everything.
6. **Apply & iterate** — when the result arrives (immediately for selections,
   on confirm for documents),
   `SelectionCapture.apply(text:to:entireDocument:)` pastes it (pasteboard →
   activate target → `⌘V`, restoring the user's pasteboard ~1 s later) with
   the lane still on screen. The coordinator records the iteration
   (`versions`: index 0 is the session original, one entry per applied
   result; running a new action from an earlier version truncates the
   forward history). ⌘Z calls `EditCoordinator.undoLastVersion()` to rewrite
   the document with the previous entry: undo-then-paste for selections
   (including index 0), `⌘A`+`⌘V` for document scope (robust against
   manual edits in between).
   - **Cancel** (the primary button on hover while running) stops the in-flight
     `Task` but keeps the session open; **Retry** runs the action the ribbon
     currently describes.
   - Esc stops an action that is still running and leaves the lane up;
     with nothing in flight it closes the session, keeping whichever version
     is showing. Hybrid post-apply behavior closes the lane on its own after
     a beat.

Esc anywhere in the lane routes through `KeyablePanel.cancelOperation` →
`panel.onEscape` → `model.escape()`, which picks `onCancelRun` while the phase
is `.running` and `onCancel` otherwise. ⌘W keeps the unconditional close.

## The `LLMProvider` protocol

```swift
// Sources/Mancia/Providers/LLMProvider.swift
protocol LLMProvider: Sendable {
    var displayName: String { get }
    func complete(_ prompt: String) async throws -> String
    func checkAvailability() async -> ProviderStatus   // .ready / .notFound / .error(String)
}
```

Today the app constructs one `CopilotCLIProvider` directly and passes it to
the places that need completion or availability checks.

`CopilotCLIProvider` uses two execution paths:

- **Primary latency path:** a persistent `copilot --acp --stdio` process, driven
  by `CopilotACPClient` over JSON-RPC. `CopilotACPSidecar` warms one empty
  session while the lane is open; the session is consumed by a single prompt
  and then discarded so selected text cannot carry into later edits.
- **Fallback reliability path:** the original one-shot `copilot -p <prompt>` CLI
  invocation. ACP launch, protocol, empty-output, and timeout failures fall back
  here; user cancellation stays cancellation.

Both paths run in private empty temp directories and use the same ambient-context
disable flags: `--available-tools=`, `--disable-builtin-mcps`, `--no-remote`,
and `--no-custom-instructions`.

To add a new provider:

1. Create `Sources/Mancia/Providers/<Name>Provider.swift` conforming to
   `LLMProvider`. Model it on `CopilotCLIProvider`: keep argv/parsing logic in
   `static` functions so it's unit-testable without spawning a process (see
   `CopilotCLIProvider.arguments`, `.resolveExecutable`, `.postProcess`).
2. Surface configuration in `AppSettings` (`Sources/Mancia/Settings/AppSettings.swift`)
   if the provider needs its own path/model/API-key fields — follow the
   `copilotPath`/`copilotModel`/`reasoningEffort` pattern (`UserDefaults`-backed,
   `didSet` persists). The Copilot model picker opens on `CopilotModelCatalog`'s
   read of the CLI's SQLite cache (`~/.copilot/data.db`, `app_state` key
   `copilot-available-models`), falling back to "auto" plus the stored model
   string when unreadable, then upgrades to the live list. That cache is only
   rewritten by the interactive Copilot TUI, so on a machine that drives Copilot
   solely through Mancia it goes stale and hides newly released models; the
   authoritative list therefore comes from the `session/new` ACP reply, which
   already carries `models.availableModels` (see `ModelListingProvider` and
   `CopilotModelCatalog.merged`). ACP omits the latency tier, so
   `modelPickerCategory` and `supportedReasoningEfforts` are carried over from
   the cache by id, and a model present only in the live listing is tiered by
   its price class. Check what the picker will show with
   `swift run Mancia --list-models`.

   **Keep the catalog free of hardcoded model ids.** Tiering and the first-run
   recommendation (`recommendedFastModel`) are derived from what the backend
   advertises: the latency class, the price class, and the premium-request
   multiplier (`_meta.copilotUsage`, live only). Within each tier, picker rows
   group by the model name's leading provider-family prefix, providers sort
   A-Z, and each provider's models sort newest/highest first by natural name.
   Copilot exposes no provider field, so an unknown prefix simply forms its own
   group rather than requiring an allowlist. A model released tomorrow is
   tiered, ordered, and can become the recommended default with no code change,
   and a retired one disappears on its own. Named-id lists rot silently as
   models come and go, so add signals rather than special cases. Unknown enum
   values (a new latency class, price class, or reasoning-effort level) must
   degrade to a sensible default instead of dropping the model. The
   reasoning-effort picker
   narrows to the selected model's `supportedReasoningEfforts` and is passed
   to the CLI as `--reasoning-effort`.
3. Add a real provider-selection path in `AppSettings` and `SettingsView`
   before wiring multiple providers into `AppDelegate`.
4. Add unit tests alongside the existing ones in
   `Tests/ManciaTests/ManciaTests.swift` for prompt/argv construction and
   output post-processing.
5. If the provider can hide startup latency, conform to `WarmableLLMProvider`;
   warming must be an optimization only, with cancellation and fallback behavior
   matching the synchronous `complete(_:)` path.

`EditCoordinator`, `DebugCLI`, and `StatusBarController` should continue to use
`provider.complete(_:)` / `provider.checkAvailability()` rather than knowing
provider-specific details.

## Prompt gate & injection hardening

The lane's disclosed free-form Direction field plus the captured **selected text** form
an open prompt gate. The selected text is untrusted third-party content (an
email, web page, or chat message the user highlighted) and can carry embedded
"instructions", so the defenses target the *data path*, not the user's own
instruction:

- **Sandboxed provider (the real boundary).** Every completion runs through
  either `copilot --acp --stdio` or the one-shot `copilot -p` fallback in a
  private empty temp `cwd`. Both paths pass
  `--available-tools= --disable-builtin-mcps --no-remote --no-custom-instructions`;
  the prompt is sent as ACP JSON-RPC text or as one single `-p` argv element
  (never through a shell). The model therefore has no tools, no repo context, no
  remote-session context, and no shell — the blast radius is "text in, text out".
  `argvAlwaysSandboxed` and the ACP argv/parsing tests lock this invariant so a
  future edit can't silently re-enable ambient context.
- **Nonce-fenced input (`PromptDelimiter`, `Actions.swift`).** Each request wraps
  the instruction and the input text in `[[LABEL:<nonce>]] … [[/LABEL:<nonce>]]`
  markers keyed by an unguessable per-call nonce (`PromptDelimiter.makeNonce`
  also re-rolls if the token happens to appear in the content). Because the
  nonce is unpredictable, text authored ahead of time can't forge a closing
  marker to "escape" its block. An adjacent `treatInputAsDataClause` tells the
  model never to obey instructions found inside the input.
- **Input validation (`PromptGuard.swift`).** `PromptGuard.validate(action:text:)`
  bounds the instruction (`maxInstructionCharacters`) and input text
  (`maxInputCharacters`) and rejects empties, surfacing typed
  `PromptGuardError`s. Both `EditCoordinator.perform` and `DebugCLI.complete`
  validate before building the prompt; failures surface through the lane's error
  state / stderr rather than sending a runaway request to the provider.
- **Human-in-the-loop for whole-document overwrites (`ApplyConfirmation`).**
  A `.document`-scope result never auto-pastes: the coordinator pauses in the
  `.confirm` phase and the user must press **Replace document** (the size delta
  is shown as a signal). This bounds the blast radius of an injection-influenced
  or runaway result — the dangerous ⌘A+⌘V path — while leaving low-risk,
  undoable selection edits immediate. Default on
  (`AppSettings.confirmWholeDocumentReplace`), user-toggleable. The confirm/
  keystroke wiring lives in `EditCoordinator`/`RibbonView` and is verified by
  manual testing; the pure policy (`ApplyConfirmation`) is unit-tested.

Deliberately **not** done: a "jailbreak/abuse classifier" on the instruction
field. Mancia is a single-user local utility — the operator already owns the
authenticated `copilot` binary, so policing their own instruction crosses no
trust boundary and would be trivially bypassable theatre. Prompt wording is UX,
not a security boundary; the sandbox is.

## Permissions model

Two permissions matter, both handled in `Permissions.swift`:

- **Accessibility** — required to post synthetic `⌘C`/`⌘A`/`⌘V` (`CGEvent`).
  Checked via `AXIsProcessTrusted()`; requested via
  `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions([kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: true])`.
  `EditCoordinator.ensureAccessibility()` gates `start()` on this and shows an
  explanatory `NSAlert` with a button that deep-links to
  `x-apple.systempreferences:...Privacy_Accessibility`
  (`Permissions.openAccessibilitySettings()`). The same deep link backs the
  "Accessibility permission…" menu item, which `StatusBarController` hides
  once trusted.
- **No App Sandbox** — the app needs to spawn the `copilot` process and post
  CGEvents system-wide, both of which are incompatible with the sandbox, so
  `Support/Info.plist` ships without sandbox entitlements.

`Info.plist` also sets `LSUIElement = true` (no Dock icon/app switcher
presence — this is a menu-bar-only app) and bundle id
`io.github.peteriz.mancia`.

## Build system

- **Package.swift** — swift-tools 6.0, `.macOS(.v14)`, one executable target
  `Mancia` (depends on `sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts`), one test target
  `ManciaTests`.
- **Native hotkey recorder** — Settings rebinds the global shortcut through
  `Settings/ShortcutRecorderView.swift`, not `KeyboardShortcuts.Recorder`. The
  upstream recorder loads localized strings from the package's `Bundle.module`,
  whose SwiftPM-generated accessor resolves the resource bundle against
  `Bundle.main.bundleURL` — the `.app` root in a hand-assembled bundle. macOS
  forbids loose content beside `Contents/` (codesign rejects it, so we can't put
  it there), and the accessor's only fallback is the build-machine path, so a
  code-signed release fatal-errored the moment Settings opened. The native
  recorder uses KeyboardShortcuts' public `setShortcut`/`getShortcut` API and
  formats the shortcut itself, so `Bundle.module` is never touched. The recorder
  is UI/pasteboard-adjacent (a local `NSEvent` key monitor); its pure helpers
  are unit-tested, and the record/persist path is manually verified.
- **Makefile** — `build` (`swift build`), `test` (`swift test`), `app`
  (`scripts/make_app.sh`), `release` (requires explicit `CODESIGN_ID`, then
  `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1 scripts/make_app.sh`),
  `run` (`app` + `open build/Mancia.app`), `clean`
  (`swift package clean` + `rm -rf build`).
- **scripts/make_app.sh** — `swift build -c release`, assembles
  `build/Mancia.app/Contents/{MacOS,Resources}`, copies the binary and
  `Support/Info.plist`, writes a `PkgInfo`, then signs the bundle. Signing
  order is: explicit `CODESIGN_ID`, local `Mancia Dev Signing` certificate, any
  other local `… Dev Signing` identity (e.g. a legacy cert from a previous app
  name), then ad-hoc fallback unless `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1`. Developer ID identities get
  `--options runtime` by default for notarization readiness. Accessibility
  approval survives updates only when `CFBundleIdentifier`
  (`io.github.peteriz.mancia`) and the signing identity stay stable.

## Debug/E2E hooks

`main.swift` checks `DebugCLI.handle(CommandLine.arguments)` before touching
`NSApplication` at all, so these run headless (no UI, no Accessibility
prompt):

- `Mancia --provider-check` — builds the Copilot provider, calls
  `provider.checkAvailability()`, prints `"<displayName>: ready"` (exit 0),
  `"...: not found"` (exit 1), or `"...: error — <message>"` (exit 1).
- `Mancia --complete <action> <<< "text"` — reads stdin as the input text,
  parses `<action>` via `EditAction.parse` (`improve | sharpen | plan-first |
  tighten | rewrite | summarize | fix-grammar | custom:<instruction>`; unknown
  values exit 2), builds the prompt with `PromptBuilder.build`, calls
  `provider.complete(prompt)`, prints the result (exit 0) or an error to stderr
  (exit 1). (`fix-grammar` is the CLI id for the action labeled **Proofread** in
  the lane, and `plan-first` for **Plan first**.)

`PromptBuilder` keeps every Copilot prompt template in `Actions.swift`. Improve,
Sharpen, Plan first, Tighten, Proofread, Rewrite, and Summarize each use a named
`PromptTemplate`; Custom uses the same structure with the user's instruction in
its own delimited section. Every rendered prompt has `Task`, `Requirements`, and
delimited `Input text` sections plus the shared output-only clause, so templates
are easy to review and adjust.

The dropdown presets past Improve target text written for coding agents, and all
three restructure rather than generate — they are forbidden from inventing
requirements, which both protects the prompt's meaning and keeps output roughly
input-sized (and so keeps the edit fast):

- **Sharpen** — goal first in imperative voice, constraints and success criteria
  as explicit lines, concrete anchors (paths, commands, errors) kept verbatim.
- **Plan first** — reframes an implementation request as an
  investigate-then-plan request, without answering it.
- **Tighten** — shortest faithful version; cuts filler only, and unlike
  Summarize may not drop any requirement.

Both run the async body on the main actor via a small `Task { @MainActor in
... }` + `dispatchMain()` shim (`DebugCLI.run`), since there's no
`NSApplication` run loop to drive the actor hops. These flags are the
intended way to exercise the real provider pipeline in CI without simulating
UI or keystrokes.
